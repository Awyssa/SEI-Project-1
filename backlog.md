0. add a win function
1. needs a game timer
2. needs a easy, medium, and hard difficulty
2.1 Easy = width 10 * 10, 5 wrong, timer = 3 mins
2.2 Medium = width 15 * 15, 3 wrong, timer = 2 mins
2.3 hard = width 25 * 25, flags 1 wrong
3. recursion function so that when a safe cell adacent to cell clicked runs function on itself. Current issue is that is that it needs class and id items or it breaks, cannot contiune chain reaction to the end of grid without breaking, or run on top or bottom cells.
4. issue that players can easily inspect board or console.log to see where mines are and win.
